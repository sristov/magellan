# Maternal Genealogy Lineage Analyser - MaGelLAn v1.5.0.

Authors: Ino Čurik, Dalibor Hršak and Strahil Ristov

Software for processing and analysis of the pedigree data with emphasis on the maternal lineage and mitochondrial DNA information. In version 1.5 MaGelLAn is a suite of four principal Python scripts (modules): *mag_verif*, *mag_stat*, *mag_calc* and *mag_sampl*, as well as two auxiliary scripts: *recode.py* and *print_line.py*. A detailed description of the main MaGelLAn modules functionality can be found in the paper:

## General notes

Each module performs the initial verification of pedigree correctness. In case of errors in the
pedigree, module *mag_verif* outputs the description of errors, while other modules abort the
execution and direct the user to module *mag_verif*.

<u>Input format</u>

Magellan modules accept input file name as an argument on a command line. If this argument
is not present the default input file name is **pdg_in.csv**. The input file must be in CSV
(comma-separated values) format. The first line is a header that includes five mandatory
keywords:

> **ID**      (name tag of an individual in the pedigree)  
> **father**   
> **mother**  
> **YOB**     (year of birth in single number format)  
> **gender**  (‘1’ for male, ‘2’ for female)  

and two optional keywords:

> **haplotype** (name tag of a haplotype; if present, haplotype data enables full
functionality of all modules, however, modules are partially functional
without it)  
>
> **available** (‘1’ for available, anything else for not available; exclusive use in
module *mag_sampl*)  

The place of keywords in the header line must match the column with the corresponding
information in the pedigree file. <u>If a keyword is present but the corresponding column is
missing the program crashes.</u>

An example of valid first lines in the input pedigree file is:

```
anything,ID,mother,father,gender,anything,YOB,haplotype,available,anything,
1,Id100,0,0,1,anything,2000,,,anything,
2,Id101,Id102,Id100,2,anything,2005,hap1,1,,
3,Id102,0,0,2,,2001,hap1,0,anything,
```

The same example in a “clean” form (without unused columns and with explicit ‘0’ for non-
available individuals):

```
ID,father,mother,YOB,gender,haplotype,available,
Id100,0,0,2000,1,,0,
Id101,Id100,Id102,2005,2,hap1,1,
Id102,0,0,2001,2,hap1,0,
```

Additional input files are:

**reference_years.txt** - stores the first and the last year of birth for the individuals included in
the reference population; formatted as two numbers in two lines; used in modules *mag_ stat*,
*mag_calc* and *mag_sampl*  

**planned_number_of_sequencings.txt** - stores the number of planned sequencings; formatted
as one number in a single line; exclusive use in module *mag_sampl*; overrides command line keyword --K  

If any of the additional files is missing, the default values (coded in the scripts) are used.

Optional output file:

**autocorrection_log.txt**

This file is created in all modules in case when one or more individuals in the pedigree have a
non-empty mother or father field, without that ancestor being present with an individual
record in the pedigree. In cases when the same ancestor occurs twice or more in such a
situation, a new record is created. If she or he is mentioned only once, the ancestor data is
treated as an empty field. This action is performed automatically and does not affect the
operation of the modules. If this occurs, the corrected records are documented in the above
file.

## Module mag_verif

Finds inconsistencies in female haplotype line. Calculates haplotype error rates. Performs the
verification of a pedigree and lists found errors. Initially performs the search for standard
pedigree errors and, if found, reports the errors in ERROR_ALERT.TXT file before stopping.

Output files are:

**OutputVerif_Summary.txt** - displays the statistics related with pedigree conflicts and HC,
IC and MISPLACED indices

**OutputVerif_ConflictingIndividuals.txt** - lists all conflicting individuals with their
haplotype and number of conflicts

**OutputVerif_DetailedConflictingIndividuals.txt** - lists all conflicting individuals with their
haplotype in more detail

**OutputVerif_MisplacedBranches.txt** - lists haplotyped individuals belonging to misplaced
branches, if the misplaced branches exist in a pedigree

and, optionally, if a fatal error is found:

**ERROR_ALERT.TXT**

This output file reports the encountered fatal errors in the pedigree file. Fatal errors are
gender inconsistencies and cycles in the lineage. Year of birth inconsistencies produce 
a warning, but the execution continues. Since it is neither possible to calculate the effective
population sizes, nor to suggest the proper individuals for sampling if such errors exist in a
pedigre, they must be corrected before using other modules. If a fatal error is encountered in
any of the other modules the program aborts execution.

## Module mag_stat

Bookkeeping module. Outputs various useful distributions of individuals over maternal
pedigree lines. In particular, lists all individuals belonging to a given founder dam line with
the corresponding haplotype. Requires an input pedigree without conflicts in maternal
haplotype lines.

Output files are:

**OutputStat_DamLineMembership_1.txt** - lists the assignment to founder female line for all
individuals in a pedigree, effectively imputing the known haplotypes to each individual in
pedigree; the format is explicit and easily readable

**OutputStat_DamLineMembership_2.txt** - the same as above, but the format is adjusted to
facilitate further processing with spreadsheet programs; less readable

**OutputStat_DamLineMembershipAllInRefPop.txt** – lists the assignment to founder female
line for all individuals in reference population; these individuals are included in haplotype line
effective population size calculation

**OutputStat_DamLineMembershipFemaleOnlyInRefPop.txt** - lists the assignment to
founder female line for only female individuals in reference population; these individuals are
included in maternal line effective population size calculation

**OutputStat_DamLinesWithFemalesInRefPop.txt** – lists the details of a female line
representation for lines that have female descendants in reference population

**OutputStat_DamLinesWithOnlyMalesInRefPop.txt** - lists the details of a female line
representation for lines that have only male descendants in reference population; such lines
carry the information about haplotype but are lost in the maternal lineage

## Module mag_calc
Calculates the effective population size separately for founder dam lines, founder haplotype
lines, and founder sire lines. Requires an input pedigree without conflicts in maternal
haplotype lines. A meaningful haplotype line N<sub>e</sub> can be computed only if enough of the
individuals are sampled.

Output file is:

**OutputCalc_InputAndResults.txt**

Together with the results of calculations, this file lists the details of pedigree maternal lineage
statistics, including all quantities used in the calculations. The information about the number
of founder dam lines in reference population with only one sample is important since there is
no possibility of verification of the obtained haplotype. Such lines may be treated differently
in the further analysis.

## Module mag_sampl

Accepts the optional “available” column with (‘1’ / anything) values. Calculates the target
number of the individuals per dam line for sequencing within given planned number of
sequencing. Restricts the target numbers to available individuals if *available* data is present.
Selects the candidates that provide the highest potential for haplotype diversity within dam
line. Requires an input pedigree without conflicts in maternal haplotype lines.

When no haplotype data is available in the input pedigree, the algorithm uses one of the available
fast methods for the selection of individuals for sampling implemented in the external script *fast_sampler.py*, 
as described in Hršak, D.; Katanić, I.;  Ristov, S. A Fast Method for the Selection of Samples in 
Populations with Available Genealogical Data. *Diversity* **2022**, *14*, 150. <https://doi.org/10.3390/d14020150>.  
Otherwise, if haplotype data is present in the pedigree, the algorithm applies the slower method implemented in
MaGelLAn 1.0.

Usage:

```
python mag_sampl.py --filename <pedigree.csv> --K <planned_number_of_sequencings> --method <fast_sampling_method>
```

Input keywords:

> --filename: name of the input pedigree file in CSV format (default: **pdg_in.csv**)  
> 
> --K: planned number of sequencings (default: 100). Same effect is obtained using the optional input file
> **planned_number_of_sequencings.txt**  
> 
> --method: fast sampling method **only** in case no haplotype data is available in the input pedigree,
> accepted options are "greedy" and "default" (default: "greedy")
> 

Output files are:

**OutputSampl_IndividualsForSampling.txt** – for each founder dam line lists the selection of
individuals for sequencing that would cover the highest diversity in pedigree; if the intended
number of sequencings *N* is less than the number of lines only one (central***) individual is
selected from the first *N* lines with the largest representation in reference population; if
*available* data is present the choice of individuals is restricted to the available individuals;
the percentages of the total population and reference population for each dam line are also being
listed here

**OutputSampl_DetailedInfo.txt** – presents the details of calculation; for each dam line lists
the number of individuals in the reference population, and the breakdown of the target number
of samples in the numbers of the previously sampled and the samplings that remain to be
done; the target number per line is obtained from the planned number of samplings as a factor
proportional to the line size

and, optionally, if *available* data is present:

**OutputSampl_AvailabilityRestrictions.txt**

This file lists the restrictions imposed if the available number of individuals per line is smaller
than the target number. AvailableAllCount includes available and already sampled
individuals. AvailableRealCount is the number of available non-sampled individuals. DIFF is
the difference between the target number of samplings and the number of available
individuals per line. If there are more available individuals than the target number per line, the
reamaining number of available individuals is reported.

## Script recode.py

An auxiliary independent script to change individual idetification marks in pedigree from strings to integers,
as required by some downstream software packages.

Usage:

```
python recode.py filename.csv --output output.csv
```

Input options:

> filename: obligatory field, input filename of the pedigree
> 
> --output: filename of the output CSV file, default: filename_recoded.csv  

Example input:

```
ID,father,mother,YOB,gender,haplotype,available,
Id100,0,0,2000,1,,0,
Id101,Id100,Id102,2005,2,hap1,1,
Id102,0,0,2001,2,hap1,0,
```

Produced output:

```
ID,father,mother,YOB,gender,haplotype,available,
1,0,0,2000,1,,0,
2,1,3,2005,2,hap1,1,
3,0,0,2001,2,hap1,0,
```

## Script print_line.py

An auxiliary independent script that for a selected founder extracts all the descendants of the same 
gender, born in a selected time span. It accepts a pedigree CSV file as an input and produces at the 
output a pedigree in CSV form restricted to the selected founder's lineage. It will print output only for 
the descendants of the same gender as the founder.

Usage:

```
python line_print.py filename.csv --output output.csv --founder FOUNDER_ID --gender GENDER --start-year START_YEAR --end-year END-YEAR
```

Keywords:

> filename: Name of the input pedigree CSV file, obligatory keyword
> 
> --output: Name of the output pedigree CSV file, default: FOUNDER_ID_fromSTART_YEAR_toEND_YEAR.csv.
> 
> --founder: Name of the founder, obligatory field.
> 
> --gender: Gender of the founder line, must correspond to the founder's gender, default: female.
> 
> --start-year: The earliest year of birth of the individuals printed in the output.
> 
> --end-year: The last year of birth of the individuals printed in the output.

The individual selected for it's lineage print must be a founder in it's gender line, *i.e.* a dam must not have a defined mother 
and a sire must not have a defined father, otherwise the script will terminate with an error. The founder must also be defined in 
the pedigree. When restricting the year of birth range, the founder doesn't need to be born within the given range. Strings referring to the 
START_YEAR and END_YEAR are omitted from the output file name if their respective options are not defined in the command line.

## Software availability

MaGelLAn v1.5.0. source codes, pedigree examples and this help file can be downloaded from:  

<http://lissp.irb.hr/software/magellan-1-0/> and <https://github.com/sristov/magellan>  

Changing the *haplotype* and *available* keywords in header lines of the example pedigree files
into anything else will exclude the data in the corresponding pedigree columns. This can be
used to test different functionalities of the software.
